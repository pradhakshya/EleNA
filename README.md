# EleNA-Spring-MVC

Elevation Based Navigation System 

EleNA is a navigation system designed to discover both the maximum and minimum elevation gain paths between a specified starting and ending point. It calculates a route that optimizes either the maximum or minimum elevation gain while limiting the total distance between the locations to a certain percentage of the shortest path.
For fitness enthusiasts like joggers or bikers looking for a rigorous workout, maximizing the elevation gain can be advantageous. On the other hand, individuals who prefer avoiding steep inclines during their route may benefit from minimizing the elevation gain.

To achieve this, we will be implementing the project using a UI-specific approach, utilizing Dijkstra's algorithm for path calculation.
